<p>The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure is beginning the process of reauthorizing surface transportation programs. Surface transportation programs include projects from the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit Administration. Funds for these projects will come directly from the Highway Trust Fund. The Committee has provided an opportunity for each Member to submit requests for certain highway and transit project designations located in their respected congressional districts. These projects are eligible under title 23, United States Code, and chapter 53 of title 49, United States Code. Each request is required to meet strict eligibility guidelines from the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and requests must have no financial ties to Members of Congress and their immediate family. Representative Guthrie has certified that none of the requests he has submitted for Second District projects have financial ties to him or his immediate family. Requests are required to demonstrate strong community support and backing from local and state governments. In accordance with committee guidelines, below are the Member Designated Projects that Representative Guthrie submitted to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.</p>
<p><b><span style="font-size: 20px;">PROJECTS</span></b><br />
<i>In alphabetical order by county</i></p>
<p><b>Project Name:</b> Bullitt County; "Reconstruction of KY 44 from US 31E to KY 1319"<br />
<b>Project Location:</b> 2.3-mile section of Highway 44 in Mount Washington, Kentucky 40047<br />
<b>Project Sponsor:</b> Kentucky Transportation Cabinet<br />
<b>Requested Amount:</b> $4.8 million<br />
<b><a href="https://guthrie.house.gov/UploadedFiles/Bullitt_County-_Member_Certification_Letter.pdf"><span style="color: blue;">Member Certification Form</span></a><br />
</b><b>Project Summary:<br />
</b>Mount Washington is a small community outside of Louisville, Kentucky and is the second fastest growing community in the Commonwealth. Along this section of road there is currently an overcrowded high school and a middle school. Also, there is an elementary school scheduled to open in 2022. In addition, there is a 600-home residential development and a 400-unit senior living facility currently under construction. The Highway 44 expansion project is an important safety and economic development project for the residents of Bullitt County, surrounding counties, and for others traveling through the area. This highway is the only east/west route connecting Bullitt County to Spencer and Jefferson counties; however, it is a largely rural road. There are no shoulders to pull off onto for emergency vehicles to pass and no alternative routes to get around accidents on this highway. Crash data reveals 252 crashes along this section of KY 44 over the last 10 years, including 122 rear-end collisions. This project will enhance safety for residents and motorists in Bullitt County. The proposed federal funding of this project would accelerate the completion timeline.</p>
<p><b>Project Name:</b> Daviess County; "Improve KY 54 from west of the US 60 Bypass to CR 1021"<br />
<b>Project Location:</b> 5.55-mile section of KY-54 in Owensboro, Kentucky 42303<br />
<b>Project Sponsor:</b> Kentucky Transportation Cabinet<br />
<b>Requested Amount:</b> $4.6 million<br />
<b><span style="color: #0070c0;"><a href="https://guthrie.house.gov/UploadedFiles/Daviess_County-_Member_Certification_Letter.pdf">Member Certification Form</a><br />
</span></b><b>Project Summary:<br />
</b>This project is anticipated to address safety concerns and reduce congestion along Kentucky 54 east of the US 60 Bypass. This road is the primary access for a 250-acre mixed-use development property. This includes over 500,000 square feet of retail, restaurant and entertainment space along with hotels, and professional and medical offices. The same section of Kentucky 54 serves two elementary schools and an additional middle school is under construction. This widening project will better accommodate new developments that are under construction and planned in the near future. Traffic is anticipated to increase by more than 60% in the next 20 years. Today this section of roadway varies from a 5-lane template to a 2-lane rural template with minimal shoulders. Crash data shows over 800 accidents within this 5.55-mile stretch over the past 3 years. The proposed federal funding of this project would accelerate the completion timeline dramatically.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Project Name:</b> Grayson County; "Extend KY 3155 from the southern Intersection at KY 259 westerly to KY 54"<br />
<b>Project Location:</b> 1.66-mile extension of the William Thomason Byway in Leitchfield, KY 42754<br />
<b>Project Sponsor:</b> Kentucky Transportation Cabinet<br />
<b>Requested Amount:</b> $4.2 million<br />
<b><a href="https://guthrie.house.gov/UploadedFiles/Grayson_County-_Member_Certification_Letter.pdf"><span style="color: blue;">Member Certification Form</span></a><br />
</b><b>Project Summary:<br />
</b>This project is anticipated to enhance vehicle safety for Grayson County residents and provide greater opportunity for economic development. Specifically, the extension of the byway will enable expedited traffic flow for larger vehicles and distance travelers. This project also opens the community to opportunities for advancement and growth in the undeveloped areas. Additionally, it will ease motor safety concerns by easing congestion and adding this extension of roadway, which will result in fewer vehicle accidents on this bypass. The proposed federal funding of this project would accelerate the completion timeline.</p>
<p><b>Project Name:</b> Hancock County; "Improve westbound lanes of US 60 from KY 1957 to KY 6106"<br />
<b>Project Location:</b> 6.28-mile section of U.S. 60 in Lewisport, KY 42351<br />
<b>Project Sponsor:</b> Kentucky Transportation Cabinet<br />
<b>Requested Amount:</b> $3.2 million<br />
<b><a href="https://guthrie.house.gov/UploadedFiles/Hancock_County-_Member_Certification_Letter.pdf"><span style="color: blue;">Member Certification Form</span></a><br />
</b><b>Project Summary:<br />
</b>This project is anticipated to make significant improvements and upgrades to U.S. 60. This section of U.S. 60 is a thoroughfare for extensive industrial traffic, and upgrades to this section of the highway benefit all local and transient travelers. Multiple industries and the local school system use this section of highway daily. In addition to easing congestion, this critical project will ease serious safety concerns. The lanes on U.S. 60 in Hancock County are currently narrow with no shoulders and have resulted in numerous accidents, many of which involved overturned semi-trucks. Some of these accidents also resulted in hazardous materials being spilled. This project will address these safety concerns for the residents of Hancock County, as well as the workers who travel on US-60 to and from the industries located in Hancock County. The proposed federal funding of this project would accelerate the completion timeline.</p>
<p><b>Project Name:</b> Hart County; "KY 335 improvements from US 31W south of KY 218 to I-65 "<br />
<b>Project Location:</b> 1.35-mile section of KY 335 in Horse Cave, Kentucky 42749<br />
<b>Project Sponsor:</b> Kentucky Transportation Cabinet<br />
<b>Requested Amount:</b> $3.2 million<br />
<b><a href="https://guthrie.house.gov/UploadedFiles/Hart_County-_Member_Certification_Letter.pdf"><span style="color: blue;">Member Certification Form</span></a><br />
</b><b>Project Summary:<br />
</b>Horse Cave was once a small town that was built up around a railroad crossing and the crossroads of two rural roads, Highway 335 and Highway 31E. Now it is the home of rapidly growing manufacturers capitalizing on its proximity to Interstate 65.&nbsp; The growth has caused problems with safety and congestion. The current connector from US- 31 West to Interstate 65 in Horse Cave poses a safety hazard, which has been exacerbated by the growth of the industrial park and resulting increase in traffic. Semi-trucks in particular coming from I-65 to US-31 have difficulty using the connector due to limited space. This project will benefit the residents of Hart County, the workforce who commute from surrounding counties, and tourists who come to the area to visit Mammoth Cave National Park. The proposed federal funding of this project would accelerate the completion timeline.</p></span>
