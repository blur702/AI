# Dashboard Frontend - Production Environment
# Used when building with: npm run build:production

# API Configuration
# Production uses same-origin API calls (determined by window.location.origin)
# No explicit API URL needed as dashboard is served from same origin as Flask backend

# Development host override (not used in production)
# VITE_DEV_HOST is only for local development
